before downloading and using the source code try to read the report attached to the code.

the report will give you also instruction on how to compile and use the code.

if you want to use this code, I strongly suggest to have a look at OpenCV library and related tutorial first.

OPENC CV official site is: https://opencv.org/

you can find plenty of tutorial in this link: https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/opencv_tutorials.pdf

if you have money, offcourse the paid course will help you a lot. you can find plenty here: https://opencv.org/courses/

after learning enough from the tutorial, you can come back here and follow this proejct.

I have compiled an openCV library for windows 10 pro edition and Qt 5.13.1. 

this instruction will help you to do know how I compiled the library using Cmaker:
https://wiki.qt.io/How_to_setup_Qt_and_openCV_on_Windows 

in addition to above refrences, I suggest you to have a look at following references too:
